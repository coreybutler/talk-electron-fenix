### Synopsis

Electron allows developers to build cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Apps like Atom, Slack, VS Code, Nylas and other professional software are all built with Electron.

Corey Butler will provide a real-world overview of Electron based on his experience creating Fenix 3.0. He'll cover starting points, lessons learned, commercial use, and a comparison to other similar technologies. This will be a high-level overview with just enough detail to help you understand why you should or shouldn't choose Electron for your next app. The talk will conclude with a demonstration of the next release of Fenix.

Fenix is a simple static web server for the desktop. 40,000+ productive frontend developers working at organizations like Adobe, Microsoft, Twitter, MIT, Harvard, Slack & Yelp use it to simplify their work, experiment with new web technology, and collaborate with their peers.
